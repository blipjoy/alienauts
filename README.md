# Alienauts

A 2D physics puzzle-adventure.

## Back story

### Roswell, NM 1947.

A high-altitude surveillance balloon crashes onto a ranch.  Initial reports
indicate it is a flying saucer with a crew of three small "human-shaped" beings
with large heads and eyes.  The wreckage is said to be transported to the
Nevada desert at a top-secret military base known to the general public as
"Area-51".

No evidence exists to verify these claims.

### Vicinity of Southern California, USA circa 2012

A recently "lost" communications satellite falls from the night sky in a
spectacular display to the desert floor below.  Conspiracy theorists and public
imagination spark stories of an alien craft shot down by the US Air Force and
taken to a decommissioned secret nuclear bunker.  Some claim that two humanoid
creatures were found alive in the wreckage.

The only evidence available are photos of a metallic debris and the temporary
loss of TV service to much of the southwestern United States.

## About

Play as one of the stranded alien survivors, attempting to outsmart the lab
coats as they keep a keen watch on your every move.  The scientists studying you
are most interested in your escape pod's ability to create a temporary but exact
replica of certain materials.

Recognizing your small stature and fragility in Earth's environment, they allow
you to pilot the small escape pod through various tests designed to evaluate
cognitive ability.  You feel very much like a mouse in a maze.

The tests start out easy, and become progressively more challenging.  All the
while, you are searching for a way to escape the facility; you are piloting an
escape pod, after all.

However, the escape pod has very limited range of motion in Earth's atmosphere.
Even its most powerful propellant beam is only enough for a short hover.  The
escape pod's light weight also makes it extremely sensitive to turbulence, and
generally unstable while maintaining flight.

Cloned items created by the escape pod phase out of existence after a brief
period, roughly 10 seconds.  This is your most valuable tool for getting around
effectively; clone a handful of balloons to lift your escape pod, or clone some
rocks for a little extra weight.  Use the environment to your advantage.

## Controls

[TODO]

* Move the flying saucer by tap-and-drag; it will follow where you are pointing.
* Clone some kinds of materials by tapping on them.
* Materials that can be cloned can also be attached to other items with ropes;
  tap-and-drag from the item being cloned to the item you want attached.
